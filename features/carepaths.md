# Carepath Templates

The Carepath Templates feature enables healthcare teams to create, manage, and track structured patient care journeys. Templates define the steps patients follow through their treatment process.

## Overview

## Key Features

- Duplicate templates for quick variations
- Import/export templates as JSON for sharing

### Step Types
- **Questionnaire Steps**: Embed forms for patient data collection
- **Task Steps**: Define actions for care team members
- **Milestone Steps**: Mark significant progress points

### Version History
- Track all changes to templates over time
- View version history with change details
- Restore previous versions when needed

### Patient Assignment
- Assign templates to patients
- Track patient progress through carepath steps
- Monitor completion status across all assigned patients

## User Interface
